# Weather App with Node/Express

### Welcome to my Weather App using Node & Express!

<br />

As I've been improving upon my skillsets with Javascript and server side programming, I decided to create an application that uses a server proxy that makes API calls to the infamous [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/) API!

As you might have guessed, my predominant focus on this project was to setup a backend server to handle the client requests while hiding API keys. In addition, I also integrated a rate limiting feature on making requests and api caching.

This app is currently being hosted on Heroku, and the live version can be found on my Portfolio Website:
